    "Finally, note that Gurobi also offers a method [``cbCut``](https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/8.1/refman/py_model_cbcut.html) which might well be confused with ``cbLazy``. The method ``cbCut`` is used to add *cutting planes* to strengthen the formulation of the LP relaxation and obtain a tighter bound. The method ``cbLazy`` is instead used to add missing constraints from the formulation. While the former are *valid inequalities* which are satisfied by any integer solution in the initial formulation (i.e., cutting planes are not supposed to cut off integer solutions), the latter are instead meant to cut off integer solutions which violate the inequality. In the former case, inequalities are derived from the existing constraints. In the latter, constraints are missing from the current pool of constraints. An example of the former type of cuts is a *Gomory cut*, while an example of the latter is a *subtour elimination constraint*. The former strengthens the formulation, the latter cuts off infeasible integer solutions."

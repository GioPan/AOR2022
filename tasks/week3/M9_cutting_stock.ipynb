    "# The cutting stock problem\n",
    "Consider the Cutting Stock problem introduced in the Classical Problems library. The scope of this task is to compare the two formulations provided for the problem.\n",
    "The class provided below generates random instances of the problem.\n",
    "Particularly, run the following experiment\n",
    "- Generate 10 random instances of the problem with 7 types of small rolls each (`n_types`)\n",
    "- For each instance solve the LP relaxation of the two formulations and record their objectives (LP bounds)\n",
    "- For each instance solve both integer formulations and recall solution times and optimality gaps\n",
    "- Using basic statistics, draw conclusions regarding the quality of the two formulations."

    "# Green Facility Sizing Problem -- Part 2\n",
    "Consider the Facility Sizing Problem described in Chapter 4 of the Benders Decomposition lecture notes. Assume now that a subset of the potential facilities adopt innovative technologies which reduce pollution substantially. These facilities will be called *green facilities*. Our task is to ensure a *green quota* in our distribution plan. That is, we need to ensure that at least a percentage $P\\in(0,1]$ of the quantity delivered to each customer arrives from a green facilities. Taking customer $A$ as an example, this means that $P$% of the quantity of products delivered to customer $A$ must arrive from a green facility. \n",

    "The data of an instance of the problem is provided below, together with a class that represents the problem.\n",
    "- Q1. Implement the Benders decomposition algorithm\n",
    "- Q2. Ensure that the solution obtained is the same as the one give by the non-decomposed model."

    "# Fixed Charge Network Flow\n",
    "Consider the Fixed Charge Network Flow Problem presented during the lectures. The class provided below generates random instances of the model by passing the size and a seed which sets the random numbers. This task consists of performing experiments to assess the quality of the two alternative formulations of the problem.\n",

    "## Experiment\n",
    "The scope of the experiment is to assess whether the original formulation or the variables splitting formulation provide a stronger lower bound. Perform the experiment by completing the following steps.  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set the `n_nodes` to 10 and solve 10 different instances (`seed` 1 through 10) of the LP relaxation of the original formulation \n",
    "2. Store the objective values of the LP relaxations in step 1\n",
    "3. Set the `n_nodes` to 10 and solve 10 different instances (`seed` 1 through 10) of the LP relaxation of the Variables Splitting formulation \n",

    "5. Use basic statistics to draw conclusions on the quality of the two LP relaxation bounds.\n"

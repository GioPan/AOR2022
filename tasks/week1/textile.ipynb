    "# Textile Company\n",
    "A textile company produces two types of fabric for the fashion industry, *plain* and *patterned* fabric.\n",
    "The fabrics are woven from wool on a loom and are finished by hand labor.\n",
    "A square meter of plain fabric requires $0.3$ Kg of wool, $6$ min of loom time, and $3$ hr of finishing\n",
    "labor; a square meeter of patterned fabric requires $0.5$ Kg of wool, $5$ min of loom time, and $5$ hr of finishing labor.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the next 3 months the company can procure up to 20 Kg of wool at the price of $\\$$ 3/Kg, 5 hr of loom time at the price of $\\$$ 3/minute, and 200 hr of labor at the price of $\\$$ 10/hour. \n",
    "The company realizes a $\\$$ 60/$m^2$ profit on the sale of plain fabric and a $\\$$ 65/ $m^2$ profit on the sale of patterned fabric.\n",
    "Assuming that all the fabric produced can be sold, determine how much of each type should the company produce in the next $3$ months, and how much inputs should be procured in order to maximize profits.\n",

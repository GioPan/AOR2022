    "The game requires to place $n$ stars in the grid such that each row, each column, and each island contains exactly one star.\n",
    "Moreover, all cells surrounding a cell with a star (thus up to $8$ cells) must remain empty -- observe that this rule can only be observed on instances with $n>3$. An example solution is provided in the figure below.\n",

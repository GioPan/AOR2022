    "The construction of the stadium requires the completion of a set of tasks  $\\mathcal{T}$, with each task characterized by a duration $D_t$. Furthermore, a set $\\mathcal{P}$ of precedences between tasks must be respected, where precedences are represented by tuples $(t_1,t_2)$ indicating that task $t_2$ is required in order to start task $t_1$. Your goal is to determine the earliest possible completion date for the construction?\n",
